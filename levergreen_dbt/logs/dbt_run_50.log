Compilation Error
  dbt found two models with the name "all_job_postings".
  
  Since these resources have the same name, dbt will be unable to find the correct resource
  when looking for ref("all_job_postings").
  
  To fix this, change the name of one of these resources:
  - model.levergreen_dbt.all_job_postings (models/marts/all_job_postings.sql)
  - model.levergreen_dbt.all_job_postings (models/core/all_job_postings.sql)
